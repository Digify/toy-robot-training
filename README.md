# Software training with the toy robot

This project will use the Toy Robot problem to teach some software development fundamentals.

The problem statement can be found in [`PROBLEM.md`](PROBLEM.md). This is the [famous "Toy Robot" problem](https://joneaves.wordpress.com/2014/07/21/toy-robot-coding-test/),
which has been given to candidates at REA Group for years. There are millions of solutions out there on the internet, 
but this one is uniquely yours.
